To start building peer applications for MFC on Windows, you need to download [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs), install the [.NET Framework 4.7 Developer Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55168) and the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

If you need to develop on Linux or macOS, just install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

To install MFC SDK to your project, run the following command in the [Package Manager Console](https://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/tools/package-manager-console):

```
